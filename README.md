The game I made is based on the classic “whack a mole” game. The game consists of 6 holes in which the character pops up at random, for a while, before hiding back. Points are awarded by clicking the character (with the straw hat) as it appears out of the hole. The more character you click the higher the score. However, the user has a time limit to hit as many of the characters possible, if the time hits 0 second the game is over, and the score will be recorded in the ranking table along with other users.
In order to make the game challenging I add various game modes making it harder to hit the character. This was done by reducing the time between the character being seen and the time it hides back (in the hole).
In the easy mode the user has a time limit of 20 seconds. The time for the character to be seen is much longer, than the other game modes, giving the user more time to click on the character. However, the user only gains 1 point when hitting the character unlike the harder game modes.
When playing medium game mode, the user has a reduced time of 10 seconds to play the game. Also, the time between the character being seen and the time it hides back (in the hole) is reduced, making it harder to hit the character. However, when the user hits the character, they gain 2 points.
Within the hard game mode, a skeleton pops out of random holes. If the user clicks on the skeleton the user will lose a point. If the user clicks on the character, with the straw hat, the user gains 3 points. The user has 10 seconds to play the game before the game ends.
